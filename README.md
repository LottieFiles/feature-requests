**What is LottieFiles?**

LottieFiles is a platform for testing, collaborating and discovering animations mainly catering to a community of animators, designers, developers and engineers (but we donâ€™t discriminate so everyone is welcome!).

The platform offers a range of tools and features that aim to make the discovery, creation, and implementation of Lottie animations easier and more efficient. It is also the creator of the LottieFiles plugin for After Effects which among other features also helps convert your animation file into a Lottie file.
